description: 'Runs memtier_benchmark, for a keyspace length of 1 SORTED SET key. The SORTED SET contains 5M elements and we remove members using ZREM. Throughout the course of the benchmark,the sorted set contains fewer members as we continuously remove them. The chance that we ask for a member to be removed, which was already removed, also increases. Starting with a large number of members helps us to have suffienct number of members for the duration of the benchmark, however the preload stage takes longer to complete. NOTE: using the --randomize flag ensures that we continue to remove elements the longer we run the test. Without the flag, we stop removing elements after some time, possibly we keep generating the same random numbers. '
