  ## Redis performance and observability spec change

  ### Project status:

  The following is a high level status report for currently available specs and tools.

  - [*Benchmark platforms specification*](https://github.com/filipecosta90/redis-benchmarks-specification/tree/main/redis_benchmarks_specification/setups/platforms/): **Experimental** components are released and available for beta testing.
  - [*Benchmark topologies specification*](https://github.com/filipecosta90/redis-benchmarks-specification/tree/main/redis_benchmarks_specification/setups/topologies/): **Experimental** components are released and available for beta testing.
  - [*Benchmark artifacts builder specification*](https://github.com/filipecosta90/redis-benchmarks-specification/tree/main/redis_benchmarks_specification/setups/builders/): **Experimental** components are released and available for beta testing.
  - [*Test-suites specification*](https://github.com/filipecosta90/redis-benchmarks-specification/tree/main/redis_benchmarks_specification/test-suites/): **Experimental** components are released and available for beta testing.
  - [*Spec tool implementation: API*](https://github.com/filipecosta90/redis-benchmarks-specification/tree/main/redis_benchmarks_specification/__api__/): **Experimental** components are released and available for beta testing.
  - [*Spec tool implementation: Benchmark artifacts builder*](https://github.com/filipecosta90/redis-benchmarks-specification/tree/main/redis_benchmarks_specification/__builder__/): **Experimental** components are released and available for beta testing.
  - [*Spec tool implementation: Self-contained coordinator*](https://github.com/filipecosta90/redis-benchmarks-specification/tree/main/redis_benchmarks_specification/__self_contained_coordinator__/): **Experimental** components are released and available for beta testing.
  - [*Spec tool implementation: Large scale coordinator*](https://github.com/filipecosta90/redis-benchmarks-specification/tree/main/): **Draft** components are under design, and have not been added to the specification.
  - [*Spec tool implementation: Setup agnostic cli benchmark runner (solely client)](https://github.com/filipecosta90/redis-benchmarks-specification/tree/main/redis_benchmarks_specification/__runner__/): contains the client utility that triggers the actual benchmarks against an endpoint provided. This tool is setup agnostic and expects the DB to be properly spinned beforehand.
